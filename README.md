<H2>Version 1.3.1 Character Art</H2>
Small release to add token images that were not included in the original module: Shaitan and the two hags on the 7th level.
<H2>Version 1.3.0 Hunting Grounds Added!</H2>
<p>For this update, I am adding all three scenes for the Hunting grounds.</p>
<p>It features a neutral horned dragon to replace the old OGL dragon, his side quests, a general store in Yldaris, environmental enhancements for Yldaris, and a conclusion to the caligni storyline.</p>
<p>It also makes a few light tweaks to the Farm level.</p>
<p>I also added the Wall Height mod, and several others, to my list of recommendations.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Tianze's Gauntlight Extras is a collection of of content designed to enhance the gameplay of Paizo's <em>Abomination Vaults Adventure Path</em> (often abbreviated to AV).</p>
<p>It includes annotated and soundscaped versions of each scene in the adventure path, up to the <strong>eigth</strong> level, plus additional side quests, expanded storylines, and NPC timelines.</p>
<p>The <em>Abomination Vaults Adventure Path</em> Foundry module is required for this mod to function. Many of the scenes, actors, journals and items in this module points directly to assets in the Abomination Vaults module folder.</p>
<p>The maps for Levels 9 through 10 are planned for a later update.</p>
